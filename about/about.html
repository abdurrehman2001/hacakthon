        <h3>Chinese Food Culture</h3>
        <p>A Chinese meal is consisted of two parts: staple food, normally made of rice, noodles or steamed buns, and
            <br>
            ts'ai, vegetable and meat dishes. (This is different from Western meals, which take meat or animal protein
            <br>
            as main dish). The primary eating utensils are chopsticks (for solid foods) and ceramic spoon (for soups and
            <br>
            congees). In a Chinese meal, everyone will have their own rice bowl; however, the accompanying dishes will
            <br>
            be served in communal plates and shared by all people. Normally, the dishes are often eaten together with a
            <br>
            mouthful of rice. Desserts are not main course in China; instead, Chinese desserts are considered as snacks
            <br>
            eaten between two meals. If dessert is served in the meal, they will be served during the course of meal
            <br>
            with no firm distinction made. If served at the end of the meal, the dessert is normally fresh fruit.
